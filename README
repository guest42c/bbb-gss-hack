DISCLAIMER: Everything here is under development and experiment. There are a lots of hard coded information and other non usual or non good approaches to a production environment.

This is a project that contains some hacks experiments to pull BigBlueButton video stream into GStreamer Streaming Server.

So far there are the following programs built to do it:

* tools/video-launcher.c
It creates a daemon that subscribe to bigbluebutton:meeting:participants channel at the redis server used by BigBlueButton.
When it receivas a redis message informing that a video stream started, it launches another program that uses GStreamer to launch the pipeline with the appropriate parameters obtained in the redis message.

* tools/simplepipeline.c
Its a simple gstreamer program to launch a pipeline

* tools/webmpipeline.c
It's a more elaborated program to launch a pipeline in a more reliable way.
